# Azure-Cognitive-Services_Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis using Azure Cognitive Services enables automatic identification and classification of emotions in text data, providing insights for better decision-making.

## What is sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing text or speech to determine the emotional tone or attitude of the writer or speaker towards a particular topic, product, brand, or service. The purpose of sentiment analysis is to identify the sentiment or polarity of the text, whether it is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is a common use case for natural language processing (NLP) and is used in various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research. The analysis is typically performed using machine learning algorithms that can detect patterns in language that are associated with positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

## What are Azure Cognitive Services?
Azure Cognitive Services is a set of pre-built APIs and tools that enables developers to add intelligent features to their applications without requiring extensive knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) technologies. It provides a wide range of APIs and services that can be used to enhance applications with features such as:
- [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.deeplearning.ai/resources/natural-language-processing/)
- [speech recognition](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/speech-recognition)
- [image and video analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_analysis#:~:text=Image%20analysis%20or%20imagery%20analysis,a%20person%20from%20their%20face.)
- [decision-making capabilities.](https://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/AAAS-Sampath.pdf)

Azure Cognitive Services offers various APIs and services including Computer Vision, Face, Speech, Language Understanding (LUIS), Translator, Text Analytics, and many more. These APIs can be accessed through REST APIs or SDKs in popular programming languages such as C#, Java, Python, and Node.js. The service is available on a pay-per-use basis and can be easily integrated with Azure cloud services and other third-party platforms.
